# 4-Makefile
# Complete Makefile with rules for building, cleaning, and recompiling the 'school' executable using the specified compiler, source files, and compiler flags.

# Compiler variable
CC = gcc

# Source files variable
SRC = main.c school.c

# Object files variable
OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)

# Target executable name
NAME = school

# Command for removing files
RM = rm -f

# Compiler flags
CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic

# Rule for the 'all' target
# This rule builds the 'school' executable by compiling the source files with the specified compiler flags
# and creating object files using the specified compiler.
all: $(OBJ)

# Clean rule: remove Emacs and Vim temporary files and the generated 'school' executable
clean:
	$(RM) *~ $(NAME)

# Oclean rule: remove the object files
oclean:
	$(RM) $(OBJ)

# Fclean rule: remove Emacs and Vim temporary files, the 'school' executable, and the object files
fclean: clean oclean

# Re rule: forces recompilation of all source files by running the 'fclean' rule and then the 'all' rule
