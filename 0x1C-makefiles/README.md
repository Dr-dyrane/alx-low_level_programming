## Introduction

Makefiles are essential tools for automating the build process of software projects. They define rules for compiling source files, handling dependencies, and generating executable binaries. This project covers various tasks that will guide participants through creating Makefiles to manage C programs efficiently.

## Tasks

The project consists of the following tasks:

1. `0-Makefile`: Creating a basic Makefile for building an executable named `school` using two C source files.
2. `1-Makefile`: Enhancing the previous Makefile by using variables to specify the compiler and source files.
3. `2-Makefile`: Extending the Makefile to include object files and the final executable name as variables.
4. `3-Makefile`: Adding rules for cleaning temporary files, object files, and the executable, along with a recompilation rule.
5. `4-Makefile`: Further enhancing the Makefile by including the `CFLAGS` variable to store compiler flags.
6. `5-island_perimeter.py`: A Python script to calculate the perimeter of an island represented by a grid.
7. `100-Makefile`: An advanced version of the Makefile with specific constraints and limitations to follow.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need:

- An Ubuntu 20.04 LTS operating system.
- GCC version 9.3.0.
- GNU Make version 4.2.1.

## How to Use

To use this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Dr-dyrane/alx-low_level_programming.git
```

2. Navigate to the `0x1C-makefiles` directory:

```
cd alx-low_level_programming/0x1C-makefiles
```

3. Complete the tasks as outlined in each individual task file.

4. Compile the C programs and run the Makefiles as demonstrated in each task.

## Files and Directories

The repository is organized as follows:

- `0x1C-makefiles`: The main directory containing the Makefile tasks.
- `0x1C-makefiles/0-Makefile`: Task 0 - Basic Makefile.
